- [API endpoint `Show Eshop Info`](http://docs.mergado.apiary.io/reference/core/eshops/show-eshop-info) returns more information about collecton of statistics in the `stats_collection` field.
- [API endpoint for running tasks](http://docs.mergado.apiary.io/reference/core/tasks/create-a-task) returns HTTP status `423 Locked` (instead of `303 See Other`) for projects which are read only.

- **Store:** Default algorithm used for sorting apps in the [Store](https://store.mergado.com) contained a bug.
