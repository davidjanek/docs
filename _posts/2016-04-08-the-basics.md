Mergado Apps is a way to implement new functionality that can be used by users or agencies of Mergado. This functionality is created and maintained by third-party developers or companies, i.e. Mergado team does not take responsibility for non-working applications.

## Hosting apps

All applications are hosted on _Mergado App Cloud_. Each application has its own repository and a database. App Cloud also helps developers test and develop their applications, i.e. there is no need to install Apache and PHP on localhost. The development environment can be accessed with SFTP or SSH.

## Supported technologies by App Cloud

Currently, applications written on Mergado platform can be written only in **PHP** and only **MySQL** is supported for data storage. Other programming languages (e.g. Python) and databases (e.g. PostgreSQL, Redis) are planned in the future.

## Setting up a new app

Apps are registered in the [Developers Center](https://developers.mergado.com). The registration results in a new repository on our _App Cloud_. For more information on how to set up a new up go to the [Setting Up](setting-up.html) page.
